            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>This server is basically a chaos zone where memes fly, games are won (or mostly lost), and someone’s always bringing up the most cursed topic imaginable. It’s like a group chat but slightly more organized and with way more inside jokes.</p>
            <p>We make 9/11 jokes that are as dark as the coffee you spill when reading them, and Hitler humor that's so bad, it's almost good... or just bad. We've got border hopping gags that might make you reconsider your travel plans, Hiroshima and Nagasaki punchlines that are historically inaccurate but comedically tragic, baldness jests that'll make you glad you kept your sunglasses on, and age-old humor about the, well, old.</p>
            <p>So, if you’re looking for a place to chill, laugh, and maybe question your life choices, you’re in the right spot. Welcome to the madness—good luck surviving.</p>

            <h2>Big Dick Timmy</h2>
            <p>Big Dick Timmy is a parody album created around the idea of our teacher Schwindy, affectionately called "Big Dick Randy." The album features parodies of well-known songs, all of which were reimagined with humorous lyrics. Drug God took the lead by singing over all the tracks, bringing a unique twist to each one. The Big Flame Man designed the album covers, capturing the quirky essence of the project. Keesh worked as the producer, ensuring the album came together smoothly. The entire album was made as a fun tribute to Axolotl, with the chaos and humor that defined the project.</p>

                    <p>Adam Sadler, initially the leader of a revolutionary army, later disguises himself as an "admiral" in the Marines and defeats the Celestial Dragons. Eventually, he is classified as a "pirate" and joins [Daley's Crew]. He is renowned as the world's strongest swordsman and trains Monkey D. Cod, who aspires to become the world's strongest swordsman.

                    <p>Indra, a descendant of Sasuke, once a Celestial Dragon, was disowned by his family for being the weakest sibling. Banished to Fusha village, he met Trafalgar D. Water Cod. The arrival of the Pebble Pirates sparked a war with the Marines, leading to their destruction and the death of their leader, Pebble. Not WhiteBeard joined forces with Water Cod and Indra, surviving a devastating Buster Call. They waged a relentless war against the Marines and the World Government, gaining power and Devil Fruits, wiping out the Sabaody Archipelago, and eventually attacking Marineford. In the final battle, Water Cod achieved his goal as a great doctor but died, and Indra died fulfilled. Not WhiteBeard, fueled by loss, destroys Marineford and defeats the World Government.</p>

                    <h2>The Transformation of the Marines</h2>
                    <p>Between the reigns of Not Whitebeard and No Beard, the Marines experienced a profound transformation. Following the devastation at Marineford, Not Whitebeard's capture by the Marines ten years later marked a turning point. Imprisoned in Impel Down and executed by the rejuvenated Marines, his demise paved the way for a new era. This new era saw the rebuilding of the Marines' strength and the restoration of order, heralding a rebirth of justice across the seas.</p>

                    <h2>No Beard's Quest for Power</h2>
                    <p>No Beard, a pirate on a quest for treasure, stumbled upon the legendary Demarcus Cousins frozen in ice in the Grand Line. After thawing him out, Demarcus, driven by a desire to honor his father's legacy, reformed the Greybeard Pirates and quickly rose to become a Yonko, one of the four most powerful pirates in the world. No Beard and his first mate Kamui formed the No Beard Pirates, a crew known for their strength and unity. Together, they set sail with the shared dream of making No Beard the King of the Pirates, while Kamui aimed to become a Yonko himself. Meanwhile, Monkey D. Sushi, an advanced Pacifista created by the brilliant Dr. Vegapunk, escaped from his creator's control. Seeking freedom and a place to belong, Sushi allied with the Greybeard Pirates and the No Beard Pirates, forming a formidable alliance that struck fear into their enemies. Together, No Beard, Kamui, Sushi, and Demarcus launched a daring assault on Marineford, clashing fiercely with the World Government's strongest forces. Their victory at Marineford was a testament to their strength and unity. Emboldened by their success, they turned their sights on the Celestial Dragons, liberating slaves from the oppressive trade on the Sabaody Archipelago. After these monumental battles, No Beard fulfilled his dream and was crowned the King of the Pirates, also earning the title of the world's strongest swordsman. However, this newfound glory sowed seeds of discord. Sushi, feeling overshadowed and driven by a desire to prove himself, challenged No Beard to a duel. The battle was intense and emotional. In the end, No Beard emerged victorious, disabling Sushi and leaving him on the brink of death. The weight of killing a close ally plunged No Beard into a deep depression. Wracked with guilt and sorrow, he surrendered himself to the Marines, leaving behind a legacy marked by triumph, tragedy, and the fleeting nature of power.</p>

                    <h2>The Return of Adam Madler and Demarcus Cousins</h2>
                    <p>After the battle with No Beard, Sushi is found by the Marines and repaired, reprogrammed, and enlisted to fight for them. Sushi quickly rises through the ranks, eventually becoming an admiral. Meanwhile, Adam Madler launches a surprise attack on Enies Lobby but is wounded in the battle against the numerous Marines, including Sushi, and retreats to Water 7. Not long after, Adam Madler makes a return, prompting the Marines to enlist Demarcus Cousins as a Warlord to defend Enies Lobby. However, when Adam Madler arrives for his second assault, Demarcus Cousins refuses to support the Marines. The battle ends in a crushing defeat for the Marines, with Sushi becoming severely damaged and rendered inactive. Following the Marine's loss, both Adam Madler and Demarcus Cousins rise to the status of Yonko. One year later, Trace Heatfist seizes the title of King of the Pirates, marking the end of the pirate era.</p>
